                <h2>Fullstack software developer</h2>
                <p>I am an enthusiastic team player and the very best on the field. Quite frankly, I have no idea why they have not employed me yet.</p>
                <p>There can be several reasons though. My extreme humbleness is one of them.</p>

            <h3>Instruction set</h3>       
                <p>All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very baic functions, such as reading data, writing data, jumping to adresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. (The complete list of commands that can be run by CPU is know as that...)</p>
